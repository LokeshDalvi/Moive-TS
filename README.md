🔍 Search for movies using keywords

🎬 View a list of popular movies fetched from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API

🧠 Explore a clean and responsive UI built with reusable React components

Vite – for fast and modern frontend tooling

TMDB API – to fetch real-time movie data

React Context API – for managing state across components
